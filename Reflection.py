# briefly describe your current understanding of Git

print("""what are the murkiest points: sometime I feel I do things 
without knowing what is actually happening. Just now I was trying 
to submit the file and somehow it says the permission denied for
 the directory that I made. Hopefully, I didnot make a directory, 
 git-submission, in public

- what do you feel confident in: what git can do and how to move things around using git-bash

- what do you feel needs more work: how to undo/go back when I messed it up
There is reset command but it is still unclear how much and what it is actually reseting""")
